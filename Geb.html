      <h2>Geb, The God of Earth, Vegetation, Fertility, Earthquakes, and Snakes.</h2>

          <strong>Geb</strong> was the Egyptian god of the Earth and later a member of the Ennead of Heliopolis. He had
          a viper around his head and was thus also considered the father of snakes. It was believed in ancient Egypt
          that Geb's laughter created earthquakes and that he allowed crops to grow.

          The name was pronounced as such from the Greek period onward and was originally read as Seb or some guess as
          Keb. The original Egyptian was perhaps <i>"Seb"/"Keb"</i>. It was spelled with either initial -g- (all periods),
          or with -k-point (gj). The latter initial root consonant occurs once in the Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts,
          more often in 21st Dynasty mythological papyri as well as in a text from the Ptolemaic tomb of Petosiris at
          Tuna El-Gebel or was written with initial hard -k-, as e.g. in a 30th Dynasty papyrus text in the Brooklyn
          Museum dealing with descriptions of and remedies against snakes.<br><br>
          Geb was frequently feared as father of snakes (one of the names for snake was s3-t3 – "son of the earth").
          In a Coffin Texts spell Geb was described as father of the snake Nehebkau. In mythology, Geb also often occurs
          as a primeval divine king of Egypt from whom his son Osiris and his grandson Horus inherited the land after
          many contendings with the disruptive god Set, brother and killer of Osiris. Geb could also be regarded as
          personified fertile earth and barren desert, the latter containing the dead or setting them free from their
          tombs, metaphorically described as <i>"Geb opening his jaws"</i>, or imprisoning those there not worthy to go to the
          fertile North-Eastern heavenly Field of Reeds. In the latter case, one of his otherworldly attributes was an
          ominous jackal-headed stave (called wsr.t) rising from the ground onto which enemies could be bound.

          In the Heliopolitan Ennead (a group of nine gods created in the beginning by the one god Atum or Ra),
          <u>Geb is the husband of Nut</u>, the sky or visible daytime and nightly firmament, the son of the earlier
          primordial elements Tefnut (moisture) and Shu ('emptiness'), and the father to the four lesser gods of the
          system – Osiris, Seth, Isis and Nephthys. In this context, Geb was believed to have originally been engaged
          with Nut and had to be separated from her by Shu, god of the air. Consequently, in mythological depictions,
          Geb was shown as a man reclining, sometimes with his phallus still pointed towards Nut. Geb and Nut together
          formed the permanent boundary between the primeval waters and the newly created world.<br><br>
          As time progressed, the deity became more associated with the habitable land of Egypt and also as one of its
          early rulers. As a chthonic deity he (like Min) became naturally associated with the underworld, fresh waters
          and with vegetation – barley being said to grow upon his ribs – and was depicted with plants and other green
          patches on his body.
