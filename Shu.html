          <strong>Shu</strong> (Egyptian Å¡w, "emptiness" or "he who rises up") was one of the primordial Egyptian gods, spouse and
          brother to goddess Tefnut, and one of the nine deities of the Ennead of the Heliopolis cosmogony.
          He was the god of peace, lions, air, and wind.

          In Heliopolitan theology, Atum created the first couple of the Ennead, Shu and Tefnut by masturbating or by
          spitting. Shu was the father of Nut and Geb and grandfather of Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys.
          His great-grandsons are Horus and Anubis.<br><br>
          As the air, Shu was considered to be a cooling, and thus calming, influence, and pacifier. Due to the
          association with dry air, calm, and thus Ma'at (truth, justice, order, and balance), Shu was depicted as the
          dry air/atmosphere between the earth and sky, separating the two realms after the event of the First Occasion.
          <br><br>Shu was also portrayed in art as wearing an ostrich feather. Shu was seen with between one and four
          feathers. The ostrich feather was symbolic of lightness and emptiness. Fog and clouds were also Shu's elements
          and they were often called his bones. Because of his position between the sky and earth, he was also known as
          the wind.<br>
          In a much later myth, representing a terrible weather disaster at the end of the Old Kingdom, it was said that
          Tefnut and Shu once argued, and Tefnut left Egypt for Nubia (which was always more temperate). It was said
          that Shu quickly decided that he missed her, but she changed into a cat that destroyed any man or god that
          approached. Thoth, disguised, eventually succeeded in convincing her to return.

          The Greeks associated Shu with <u>Atlas</u>, the primordial Titan who held up the celestial spheres, as they are
          both depicted holding up the sky.
          According to the Heliopolitan cosmology, Shu and Tefnut, the first pair of cosmic elements, created the sky
          goddess, Nut, and the earth god, Geb. Shu separated Nut from Geb as they were in the act of love, creating
          duality in the manifest world: above and below, light and dark, good and evil. Prior to their separation,
          however, Nut had given birth to the gods Isis, Osiris, Nephthys (Horus) and Set.[5] The Egyptians believed
          that if Shu did not hold Nut (sky) and Geb (earth) apart there would be no way for physically-manifest life
          to exist.<br><u>Shu is mostly represented as a man</u>. Only in his function as a fighter and defender as the
          sun god does he sometimes receive a lion's head. He carries an ankh, the symbol of life.
