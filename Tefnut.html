          <strong>Tefnut</strong> (Ancient Egyptian: tfnwt) is a deity of moisture, moist air, dew and rain in Ancient Egyptian religion.
          She is the sister and consort of the air god Shu and the mother of Geb and Nut. She was known as Tphenis
          to the ancient Greeks.

          Literally translating as <i>"That Water"</i>, the name Tefnut has been linked to the verb 'tfn' meaning
          'to spit' and versions of the creation myth say that Ra (or Atum) spat her out and her name was written as a
          mouth spitting in late texts.<br>
          Like most Egyptian deities, including her brother, <u>Tefnut has no single ideograph or symbol.</u> Her name in
          hieroglyphics consists of four single phonogram symbols t-f-n-t. Although the n phonogram is a representation
          of waves on the surface of water, it was never used as an ideogram or determinative for the word water (mw),
          or for anything associated with water.<br>
          Tefnut is a daughter of the solar deity Ra-Atum. Married to her twin brother Shu, she is mother of Nut,
          the sky and Geb, the earth. Tefnut's grandchildren were Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys, and, in some versions,
          Horus the Elder. She was also the great-grandmother of Horus the Younger. Alongside her father, brother,
          children, grandchildren, and great-grandchild, she is a member of the Ennead of Heliopolis.<br><br>
          There are a number of variants to the myth of the creation of the twins Tefnut and Shu. In every version,
          Tefnut is the product of parthenogenesis, and all involve some variety of body fluid.<br>
          In the Heliopolitan creation myth, Atum sneezed to produce Tefnut and Shu. Pyramid Text 527 says, <q>Atum was
          creative in that he proceeded to sneeze while in Heliopolis. And brother and sister were born - that is Shu
          and Tefnut.</q>.

          In some versions of this myth, Atum also spits out his saliva, which forms the act of procreation. This
          version contains a play on words, the tef sound which forms the first syllable of the name Tefnut also
          constitutes a word meaning <i>"to spit"</i> or <i>"to expectorate"</i>.<br>
          The Coffin Texts contain references to Shu being sneezed out by Atum from his nose, and Tefnut being spat out
          like saliva. The Bremner-Rind Papyrus and the Memphite Theology describe Atum as sneezing out saliva to form
          the twins.<br><br>
          Tefnut was connected with other leonine goddesses as the Eye of Ra. As a lioness she could display a wrathful
          aspect and is said to have escaped to Nubia in a rage, jealous of her grandchildren's higher worship. Only
          after receiving the title "honorable" from Thoth, did she return.
