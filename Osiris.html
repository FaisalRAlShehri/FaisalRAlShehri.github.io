          <strong>Osiris</strong> (/oʊˈsaɪrɪs/, from Egyptian wsjr, Coptic ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ) is the god of the afterlife, the dead,
          resurrection, and life in ancient Egyptian religion. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned deity with
          a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive atef crown, and holding a
          symbolic crook and flail. He was one of the first to be associated with the mummy wrap. When his brother, Set,
          cut him up into pieces after killing him, Isis, his wife, found all the pieces and wrapped his body up. Osiris
          was at times considered the eldest son of the god Geb and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and
          husband of Isis, with Horus being considered his posthumously begotten son. He was also associated with the
          epithet Khenti-Amentiu, meaning <i>"Foremost of the Westerners"</i>, a reference to his kingship in the land
          of the dead. Through syncretism with Iah, he is also a god of the Moon.

          Osiris is a Latin transliteration of the Ancient Greek Ὄσιρις IPA: [ó.siː.ris], which in turn is the Greek
          adaptation of the original name in the Egyptian language. In Egyptian hieroglyphs the name appears as wsjr,
          which some Egyptologists instead choose to transliterate ꜣsjr or jsjrj. Since hieroglyphic writing lacks
          vowels, Egyptologists have vocalized the name in various ways, such as Asar, Ausar, Ausir, Wesir, Usir, or
          Usire.
          Osiris was the judge of the dead and the underworld agency that granted all life, including sprouting
          vegetation and the fertile flooding of the Nile River. He was described as <i>"He Who is Permanently Benign
          and Youthful"</i> and the <i>"Lord of Silence"</i>. The Kings of Egypt were associated with Osiris in death
          – as Osiris rose from the dead so they would be in union with him, and inherit eternal life through a process
          of imitative magic.<br>Through the hope of new life after death, Osiris began to be associated with the cycles
          observed in nature, in particular vegetation and the annual flooding of the Nile, through his links with the
          heliacal rising of Orion and Sirius at the start of the new year. Osiris was widely worshipped until the
          decline of ancient Egyptian religion during the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire.

          Osiris is represented in his most developed form of iconography wearing the <u>Atef crown</u>, which is
          similar to the White crown of Upper Egypt, but with the addition of two curling ostrich feathers at each side.
          He also carries the crook and flail. The crook is thought to represent Osiris as a shepherd god. The symbolism
          of the flail is more uncertain with shepherds whip, fly-whisk, or association with the god Andjety of the
          ninth nome of Lower Egypt proposed.<br><br>
          He was commonly depicted as a pharaoh with a complexion of either green (the color of rebirth) or black
          (alluding to the fertility of the Nile floodplain) in mummiform (wearing the trappings of mummification from
          chest downward).
