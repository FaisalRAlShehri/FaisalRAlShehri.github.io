          <strong>Set</strong> /sɛt/ or Seth /sɛθ/ (Egyptian: stẖ; also transliterated Sheth, Setesh, Sutekh, Setan,
          Seth Merksamer, Seteh,[a] Setekh, or Suty) is a god of deserts, storms, envy, disorder, violence, and
          foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion. In Ancient Greek, the god's name is given as Sēth (Σήθ). Set had a
          positive role where he accompanies Ra on his solar boat to repel Apep, the serpent of Chaos. Set had a vital
          role as a reconciled combatant. He was lord of the red (desert) land, where he was the balance to Horus' role
          as lord of the black (soil) land.

          In the Osiris myth, the most important Egyptian myth, Set is portrayed as the usurper who killed and mutilated
          his own brother Osiris. Osiris's wife Isis reassembled his corpse and resurrected her dead husband long enough
          to conceive his son and heir Horus. Horus sought revenge upon Set and the myths describe their conflicts.<br>
          <br>Set is the son of Geb, the Earth, and Nut, the Sky; his siblings are Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys. He married
          Nephthys and fathered Anubis and in some accounts he had relationships with the foreign goddesses Anat and
          Astarte.<br><br>
          The meaning of the name Set is unknown but it is thought to have been originally pronounced *sūtiẖ [ˈsuw.tixʲ]
          based on spellings of his name in Egyptian hieroglyphs as stẖ and swtẖ. The Late Egyptian spelling stš
          reflects the palatalization of ẖ while the eventual loss of the final consonant is recorded in spellings like
          swtj. The Coptic form of the name, ⲥⲏⲧ Sēt, is the basis for the English vocalization. <br>
          In ancient Egyptian astronomy, Set was commonly associated with the planet Mercury. <br>

          In art, Set is usually depicted as an enigmatic creature referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal, a
          beast resembling no known creature, although it could be seen as a composite of an aardvark, a donkey, a
          jackal, or a fennec fox. The animal has a curved snout, long rectangular ears, a thin forked tail and canine
          body, with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the
          distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the giraffe,
          owing to the large flat-topped "horns" which correspond to a giraffe's ossicones. The Egyptians themselves,
          however, made a distinction between the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is depicted
          as a donkey or as having a donkey's head.
