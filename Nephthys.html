          <strong>Nephthys</strong> or Nebet-Het in ancient Egyptian (Greek: Νέφθυς) was a goddess in ancient Egyptian
          religion. A member of the Great Ennead of Heliopolis in Egyptian mythology, she was a daughter of Nut and Geb.
          Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites because of their role as protectors of
          the mummy and the god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Set.<br>
          She was associated with mourning, the night/darkness, service (specifically temples), childbirth, the dead,
          protection, magic, health, embalming, and beer.

          Nephthys is the Greek form of an epithet (transliterated as Nebet-hut, Nebet-het, Nebt-het, from Egyptian
          nbt-ḥwt).The origin of the goddess Nephthys is unclear but the literal translation of her name is usually
          given as <i>"Lady of the House"</i>, which has caused some to mistakenly identify her with the notion of a
          "housewife" or as the primary lady who ruled a domestic household. This is a pervasive error repeated in many
          commentaries concerning this deity. Her name means quite specifically "Lady of the [Temple] Enclosure" which
          associates her with the role of priestess. <br>
          This title, which may be more of an epithet describing her function than a given name, probably indicates the
          association of Nephthys with one particular temple or some specific aspect of the Egyptian temple ritual.
          Along with her sister Isis, Nephthys represented the temple pylon or trapezoidal tower gateway entrance to
          the temple which also displayed the flagstaff. This entrance way symbolized the horizon or akhet. <br><br>
          At the time of the Fifth Dynasty Pyramid Texts, Nephthys appears as a goddess of the Heliopolitan Ennead. She
          is the sister of Isis and companion of the war-like deity, Set. As sister of Isis and especially Osiris,
          Nephthys is a protective goddess who symbolizes the death experience, just as Isis represented the birth
          experience. Nephthys was known in some ancient Egyptian temple theologies and cosmologies as the "Helpful
          Goddess" or the "Excellent Goddess". These late ancient Egyptian temple texts describe a goddess who
          represented divine assistance and protective guardianship.

          Nephthys is regarded as the mother of the funerary deity Anubis (Inpu) in some myths. Alternatively Anubis
          appears as the son of Bastet or Isis.<br><br>
          As the primary "nursing mother" of the incarnate pharaonic god, Horus, Nephthys also was considered to be the
          nurse of the reigning pharaoh himself. Though other goddesses could assume this role, Nephthys was most
          usually portrayed in this function. In contrast, Nephthys is sometimes featured as a rather ferocious and
          dangerous divinity, capable of incinerating the enemies of the pharaoh with her fiery breath.
