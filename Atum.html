          <strong>Atum</strong> (/ɑ.tum/, Egyptian: jtm(w) or tm(w), reconstructed [jaˈtaːmuw]; Coptic ⲁⲧⲟⲩⲙ Atoum),
          sometimes rendered as Atem or Tem, is an important deity in Egyptian mythology.

          In the Heliopolitan creation myth, Atum was considered to be the first god, having created himself, sitting on
          a mound (benben) (or identified with the mound itself), from the primordial waters (Nu). Early myths state that
          Atum created the god Shu and goddess Tefnut by spitting them out of his mouth. Atum did so through masturbation,
          with the hand he used in this act representing the female principle inherent within him. Other interpretations
          state that he has made union with his shadow.<br><br>
          In the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians believed that Atum lifted the dead king's soul from his pyramid to the starry
          heavens. He was also a solar deity, associated with the primary sun god Ra.<br><br>
          Atum was linked specifically with
          the evening sun, while Ra or the closely linked god Khepri were connected with the sun at morning and midday.
          In the Book of the Dead, which was still current in the Graeco-Roman period, the sun god Atum is said to have
          ascended from chaos-waters with the appearance of a snake, the animal renewing itself every morning.
          Atum is the god of pre-existence and post-existence. In the binary solar cycle, the serpentine Atum is
          contrasted with the scarab-headed god Khepri—the young sun god, whose name is derived from the Egyptian hpr
          <i>"to come into existence"</i>. Khepri-Atum encompassed sunrise and sunset, thus reflecting the entire cycle of
          morning and evening.

          Atum was a <i>self-created deity</i>, the first being to emerge from the darkness and endless watery abyss that
          existed before creation. A product of the energy and matter contained in this chaos, he created his children—the
          first deities, out of loneliness. He produced from his own sneeze, or in some accounts, semen, Shu, the god of
          air, and Tefnut, the goddess of moisture. The brother and sister, curious about the primeval waters that
          surrounded them, went to explore the waters and disappeared into the darkness. Unable to bear his loss,
          Atum sent a fiery messenger, the Eye of Ra, to find his children. The tears of joy he shed upon their return
          were the first human beings.
