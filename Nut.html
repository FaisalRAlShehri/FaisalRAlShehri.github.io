          <strong>Nut</strong> (Ancient Egyptian: Nwt), also known by various other transcriptions, is the goddess of
          the sky, stars, cosmos, mothers, astronomy, and the universe in the ancient Egyptian religion. She was seen as
          a star-covered nude woman arching over the Earth, or as a cow. She was depicted wearing the water-pot sign
          (nw) that identifies her.

          The pronunciation of ancient Egyptian is uncertain because vowels were long omitted from its writing, although
          her name often includes the unpronounced determinative hieroglyph for "sky". Her name Nwt, itself also meaning
          "Sky", is usually transcribed as "Nut" but also sometimes appears in older sources as Nunut, Nent, and Nuit.
          <br>She also appears in the hieroglyphic record by a number of epithets, not all of which are understood.<br>
          <br>Nut is a daughter of Shu and Tefnut. Her brother and husband is Geb. She had four or, in some sources,
          five children: Osiris, Set, Isis, Nephthys, and in some sources Horus. She is considered one of the oldest
          deities among the Egyptian pantheon, with her origin being found on the creation story of Heliopolis. She was
          originally the goddess of the nighttime sky, but eventually became referred to as simply the sky goddess. Her
          headdress was the hieroglyphic of part of her name, a pot, which may also symbolize the uterus. Mostly
          depicted in nude human form, Nut was also sometimes depicted in the form of a cow whose great body formed the
          sky and heavens, a sycamore tree, or as a giant sow, suckling many piglets (representing the stars).<br><br>
          A sacred symbol of Nut was the ladder used by Osiris to enter her heavenly skies. This ladder-symbol was
          called maqet and was placed in tombs to protect the deceased, and to invoke the aid of the deity of the dead.
          Nut and her brother, Geb, may be considered enigmas in the world of mythology. In direct contrast to most
          other mythologies which usually develop a sky father associated with an Earth mother (or Mother Nature), she
          personified the sky and he the Earth.

          <u>Nut was the goddess of the sky and all heavenly bodies</u>, a symbol of protecting the dead when they enter
          the afterlife. According to the Egyptians, during the day, the heavenly bodies—such as the Sun and Moon—would
          make their way across her body. Then, at dusk, they would be swallowed, pass through her belly during the
          night, and be reborn at dawn.<br>Nut is also the barrier separating the forces of chaos from the ordered
          cosmos in the world. She was pictured as a woman arched on her toes and fingertips over the Earth; her body
          portrayed as a star-filled sky. Nut's fingers and toes were believed to touch the four cardinal points or
          directions of north, south, east, and west.<br>Because of her role in saving Osiris, Nut was seen as a friend
          and protector of the dead, who appealed to her as a child appeals to its mother: <q>O my Mother Nut, stretch
          Yourself over me, that I may be placed among the imperishable stars which are in You, and that I may not die.
          </q>. Nut was thought to draw the dead into her star-filled sky, and refresh them with food and wine: <q>I
          am Nut, and I have come so that I may enfold and protect you from all things evil.</q>.
